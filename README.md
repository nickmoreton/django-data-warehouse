# A Data Warehouse with Django and Scrapy

A Django app to store scraped website data with the intention to use the data as a source to import from.

**It's a work in progress and not ready for use in a production environment.**

Many parts of this project are based on previous work I have done. See the credits section below.

It's highly likely that this project will change significantly over time ðŸ’¥

## How it works so far

1. Initial command to obtain links to all pages to scrape: `scrapy crawl sitemap`
2. Collect the page content for each site map page: `scrapy crawl pages`
3. Run command `python manage.py build_blocks` to "build the blocks" from the scraped data (page content)

## Setup

You'll need a wordpress site running from which you can scrape data. I used a local install of wordpress with default theme and sample content.

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtualenv and install requirements `poetry install then poetry shell`
3. Create a database and user for the project `python manage.py migrate then python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Run the initial command to obtain links to all pages to scrape: `scrapy crawl sitemap from the warehouse/sitemap/spiders directory`
5. Collect the page content for each site map page: `scrapy crawl pages from the warehouse/pages/spiders directory`
6. Run command `python manage.py build_blocks` to "build the blocks" from the scraped data (page content). Run from the root directory of the project.

## TODO

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Refine the django admin interface
- [ ] Add a JSON API to access the data from a wagtail site for import
- [ ] and more...
